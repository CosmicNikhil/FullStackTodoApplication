# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
Frontend (ReactJS):
1. Technologies Used:
   - ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
   - HTML/CSS: For structure and styling.

2. Features Implemented:
   - Task Management:
     - Adding Tasks: Users can add new tasks with details like title, description, and due date.
     - Updating Tasks: Ability to edit existing tasks, modifying details such as title, description, and due date.
     - Deleting Tasks: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
   - User Interface: A clean and responsive UI designed using React components and styled with CSS for a pleasant user experience.
   - Authentication Handling: Integrated with backend authentication endpoints for secure user login/logout functionality.

3. Workflow:
   - Component-Based Architecture: Utilized React's component-based architecture to modularize the application, enhancing reusability and maintainability.
   - State Management: Managed application state using React's built-in `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, ensuring efficient rendering and data handling.
   - API Integration: Used Axios to communicate with backend APIs asynchronously, handling HTTP requests and responses for seamless data retrieval and updates.

Backend (Spring Boot):
1. Technologies Used:
   - Spring Boot: Framework for building enterprise Java applications.
   - Spring MVC: Used for creating RESTful APIs.
   - Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
   - Spring Security: Provided robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Hibernate: Object-relational mapping library for database interactions.

2. Features Implemented:
   - API Development:
     - Task CRUD Operations: Implemented RESTful APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
     - User Authentication: Secure endpoints using Spring Security, with support for login/logout functionality.
   - Database Integration:
     - JPA Repositories: Defined JPA repositories for interacting with a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
     - Entity Mapping: Mapped Java objects to database tables using Hibernate annotations for seamless data persistence.

3. Security Measures:
   - Authentication: Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to secure API endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can perform CRUD operations.
   - Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced through Spring Security configurations to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

Conclusion:
This full-stack To-Do application demonstrates proficiency in modern web development technologies, including ReactJS for frontend interactivity and Spring Boot for robust backend API development. The project incorporates secure authentication, seamless data management, and efficient communication between frontend and backend components, making it a comprehensive example of a scalable and maintainable web application.
